```
I lost my best friend at
twenty-three
She left her body and hovered
above me
I saw no shadow, I looked around
Searched every building
and home that I found
I saw no shadow, but felt a glow
The warmth inside me,it kept me
afloat
I felt like heaven, had found my
bones
And gave me comfort when I feel
alone
Now you're gone, I moved on
I guess it's time to get better
Through the pain
I will go alone
If I fall, break my bones
I will scream even louder
'Cause I'm not dying alone
I lost my friend at twenty-three
She left her body and hovered
above me
I lost my best friend at
twenty-three
I heard the heavens crying above
me
They gained an angel,
I lost a friend
I felt like dying again and
again
I went through hell,
I stared at eath
But I keep fighting
with each  living breath
I saw my way out
from where I stood
Felt like the fire had burnt me
for good
Now you're gone, I moved on
I guess it's time to get better
Through the pain I will go alone
If I fall, break my bones I will
scream even louder 'Cause I'm
not dying alone
I lost my best friend
Oh my God, don't do this For I
miss my I need my best friend
Oh my God, don't do this For I
miss my I need my best friend
Oh my God, don't do this
Oh my God, I need my best friend
