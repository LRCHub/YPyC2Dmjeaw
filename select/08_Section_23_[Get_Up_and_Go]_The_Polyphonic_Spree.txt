New satellite, cover's blown
I try my best to reach the phone
Protection is less, my time to show
A lot of this has really made do it and go

Why get up and go?

I crawl back home to access spot
Where worry begins and love's forgotten
A silent frame, it's off the wall
It keeps me in stride to want to do it and go

Get up and go

Waking up with a bad throat
I take it day by day
Well, you might like to think
You're in denial

Waking up with a bad throat
I take it day by day
Well, you might like to think
You're in denial, in denial

We sure feed lives with such a blast
The heads are strong, the hearts are blind
Through shallow faith, the crooked goes
Made 'em larger than life which means do it and go

Why get up and you go?

Waking up to a sad note delivered yesterday
Saying, you would like to think you're in love
Waking up to a sad note delivered yesterday
Saying, you would like to think you're in love, in love

Why do you make me cold inside, you soldier?
Marching my feelings with your lies, it's painful
Why do you make me cold inside, you soldier?
Marching my feelings with your lies, it's time to go
