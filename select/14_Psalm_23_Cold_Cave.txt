I want to storm the gates of Heaven
Take you back to where you came from
Is it a sin to live with so much love
I want to feel you in my blood
As I'm drowning in your flood
Is it a crime to live with so much lust

Oh the sun
You never needed
Don't pretend
You never ever wanted

You can take me back to your garden of love
Take me back to your garden of love
As above and so below
I'll be your shadow in the valley of death
I'll be your shadow in the valley of death
Take me 'til there's nothing left

Sacrifice
Mercy
Faith
Ecstacy
Divinity
Rapture in
Original Sin
Take my hand
I'll let you in
