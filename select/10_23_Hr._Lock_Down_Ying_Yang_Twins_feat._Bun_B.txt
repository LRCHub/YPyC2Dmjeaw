23 hr. lockdown where they treat you like a ho
Slide you a plate up under the door
Nigga have to shit in the middle of the floor
Prison ain't a place that we need to go

So till they free Pimp C
I'ma leave up to U G O K K K to keep it street
This one here for the street
This one here for the street

Life can be so hard, shit can hurt so bad
Always have you sayin' constantly making you mad
(Say free Pimp C, free Pimp C)
Life can be so hard, shit can hurt so bad
(Free Pimp C, free Pimp C)
(Free Pimp C, free Pimp C)
Always have you sayin' constantly making you mad
(Free Pimp C, free Pimp C)

In a lil' bitty room where there ain't no light
Thinkin' 'bout this is the wrong and the right
The dark and the light, the strong and the weak
Your conscious askin' you trying to get you sanity

You gotta hold your ground
Can let it sleep, there your friends in the heater ship
While they always dip
Left you by yourself stuck up, fucked up

Behind them bars, the times is hard
Thought you was smart, now you losing
Jumping around the room giving yourself febreezy
Trying all types of suicidal tactics

The people walk in and put you in strait jacket
Until they free Pimp C I'ma leave it up to U G O K K K to keep it street
That's why me and my brother
Got Bun B to bounce wit us on this beat

23 hr. lockdown in a cell can drive a nigga crazy as hell
Looking at four walls can do nothing at all
Got you feeling like a dog in a cage
A monkey on the rage and the guard
I wanna spit in your face take the privilege away

But keep your head up son, be brave
Don't let the worries of jail bring you down keep a focus head
And gain more knowledge instead
I know it's not where you wanna be
But take it from me I know everybody love to be free

So God dammit free Pimp C, I know he ready to hit the street
And jump back to makin' beats and I know that nigga miss Bun B
So we gon' keep it on the G that's comin' for my brother and me
And we gon' be here when you hit the streets
We waiting on the date that they free Pimp C

D Roc let me put something on your brain
How would you feel if they locked up Kane?
Kane how would you feel if they locked up D?
Well that's what the fuck happened to me
With Pimp C, my right hand, my best friend
My ace boom coom, man we closer than ken

We've been on the grind, holdin' it down
Till he got caught up in some bullshit, that got him some time
Almost lost my mind, started drinkin' a fifth a day
Couldn't understand why they was takin' a pimp away, why?

We right on the edge, we 'bout to blow
[Incomprehensible] need to go
Sittin' in the cell watchin' time go pass
Lookin' at your kids and your momma doin' glass
If I could turn back time I would of told him keep the glock down
But now I pray for the day he may get out 23 hr. lock down
